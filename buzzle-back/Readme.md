BUZZLE_DB_NAME=buzzle_db
BUZZLE_DB_USER=buzzle_db_user
BUZZLE_DB_PASS=...
BUZZLE_DB_DIALECT=mysql
BUZZLE_DB_TIMEOUT=2000

BUZZLE_SESSION_DB_HOST=localhost
BUZZLE_SESSION_DB_PORT=6379
BUZZLE_SESSION_DB_NAME=0
BUZZLE_SESSION_DB_PASS=...
BUZZLE_SESSION_SECRET=...

BUZZLE_PORT=8080
BUZZLE_HASHING_ROUNDS=8
BUZZLE_MIN_LOGIN_LENGTH=3
BUZZLE_MIN_PASS_LENGTH=7
BUZZLE_ADMIN_USER=chief
BUZZLE_ADMIN_PASS=...
```

After that, install npm dependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Deployment through Docker

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2. Create a `.env` file as described in 'Manual Deployment'.
3. Start the database container and the server with `docker-compose up`.
3. For development environments to be able to modify files while the container
   is running, start the system with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.development.yml up`.
   Ensure to run `npm install` locally before starting the development containers.
   Ensure that the installed modules are compatible with the current Docker
   platform.
